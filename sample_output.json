  "summary": "Sarah is a highly qualified candidate with strong technical skills and proven leadership experience. Her background in microservices, cloud infrastructure, and data pipelines aligns well with the role requirements. The only minor gap is intermediate GraphQL and no Rust experience, but her learning trajectory suggests she can ramp up quickly."
